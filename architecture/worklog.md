# Work Log: Infinitely Simple Life

This log tracks development activities and decisions for the project.

## 2025-04-29

*   **Setup:** Created `architecture/` directory with `architecture.md` and `worklog.md`.
*   **Experimentation Setup (`home.html`):**
    *   Created `home.html` as a variant of `index.html`.
    *   Replaced animated gradient with static background placeholder (`.serene-background` CSS class).
    *   Updated link card styling (border, background blur, smoother hover transition with slight scale effect via Tailwind classes).
    *   Included CDN links for `Typed.js` and `ScrollReveal.js`.
    *   Added `assets/js/home-experiments.js`.
    *   Implemented `Typed.js` on the main headline (`#typed-headline`) with multiple strings.
    *   Implemented `ScrollReveal.js` to fade-in the main text block (`#main-text-block`) and the explore section (`#explore`) on scroll.

*   **Correction & Enhancement (`home.html`):**
    *   Reverted `index.html` to its simpler state (removed scroll reveal, fading text, enhanced card styles, extra scripts).
    *   Applied enhancements intended for `index.html` to `home.html`:
        *   Set body background to `animated-gradient`.
        *   Removed Typed.js functionality; made H2 headline static ("Discover Infinite Simplicity.").
        *   Added new `p` element (`#fading-tagline`) below main paragraph for cycling text.
        *   Added CSS in `<style>` block for tagline fade effect.
        *   Applied refined card hover effects (shadow, scale) using Tailwind utilities.
        *   Ensured ScrollReveal IDs (`#main-text-block`, `#explore`) are present.
        *   Created `assets/js/home-enhancements.js` with ScrollReveal initialization and custom JS for fading tagline effect.
        *   Linked `assets/js/home-enhancements.js` in `home.html`.
        *   Deleted obsolete/incorrect JS files (`home-experiments.js`, `index-enhancements.js`).
    *   Updated `architecture.md` and `worklog.md` to reflect the correct state.
